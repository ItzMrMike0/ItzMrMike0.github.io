          <p>
            In the early twentieth century, Japan’s average life expectancy was relatively low. High infant mortality, widespread infectious diseases, poor nutrition, and limited access to medical care all contributed to shortened lifespans. Diseases such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, and diarrheal illnesses were common causes of death, particularly among children and low-income populations. Rural communities often lacked trained physicians, and sanitation infrastructure was underdeveloped, increasing exposure to preventable illness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following World War II, Japan’s life expectancy initially remained low, reflecting both long-standing public health weaknesses and the severe disruptions caused by the war. However, from the 1950s onward, life expectancy began to rise rapidly. Mortality from infectious diseases declined as vaccination programs, improved sanitation, and community-level disease prevention measures were introduced. Improvements in childhood healthcare and nutrition significantly increased survival rates.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the late twentieth century, Japan had undergone a dramatic transformation in population health. Life expectancy exceeded 80 years by the early 2000s, placing Japan among the countries with the highest life expectancy in the world. This long-term trend highlights the effectiveness of sustained investments in public health infrastructure, preventative care, and universal access to medical services.

        <div class="thesis-content">
          <p>
            World War II had a direct and devastating impact on the health of Japan’s population. Widespread bombing destroyed housing, hospitals, sanitation systems, and transportation infrastructure in major urban centers, including Tokyo, Osaka, and Hiroshima. The destruction of these essential systems sharply reduced access to clean water, safe shelter, and medical care. Mortality increased during the war years, particularly among vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and individuals already affected by illness or malnutrition.
          </p>
          <p>
            The war also severely disrupted food production and distribution. Agricultural output declined due to labor shortages, damaged farmland, and transportation breakdowns. As a result, many citizens experienced chronic undernutrition, which weakened immune systems and increased susceptibility to disease. Rationing systems were unable to meet nutritional needs, and food scarcity became a widespread problem during the final years of the war.
          </p>
          <p>
            Population displacement further intensified health risks. Millions of people were forced from their homes and into overcrowded living conditions, creating environments conducive to the spread of disease. The combined effects of infrastructure destruction, food shortages, and displacement meant that World War II significantly worsened population health and set the stage for a severe postwar crisis.

        <h2 class="thesis-title">Post–World War II Public Health Crisis</h2>
        <div class="thesis-content">
          <p>
            In the immediate postwar period, Japan faced a nationwide public health emergency. Cities lay in ruins, and millions of people were homeless, living in overcrowded shelters or temporary housing. These conditions severely compromised sanitation and hygiene, increasing exposure to disease. Medical facilities that survived the war were overwhelmed and lacked sufficient staff, equipment, and medicines to meet population needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Food shortages became one of the most pressing public health challenges of the late 1940s. Agricultural production remained low, and transportation networks were slow to recover. Daily caloric intake fell well below recommended levels for much of the population, leading to widespread malnutrition. Children, pregnant women, and the elderly were especially affected, and undernutrition contributed directly to illness and elevated mortality rates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Infectious diseases spread rapidly under these postwar conditions. Tuberculosis became one of the leading causes of death, exacerbated by overcrowding, weakened immune systems, and limited access to treatment. Public health officials increasingly recognized that stabilizing population health would require coordinated, large-scale intervention rather than reliance on individual medical care alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the end of the 1940s, the severity of the crisis made clear that comprehensive public health reforms were essential. This period marked a turning point in Japan’s health history, prompting systematic efforts in sanitation, nutrition, and disease prevention that would shape later improvements in life expectancy.
