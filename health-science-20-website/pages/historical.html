          <p>
            In the early twentieth century, Japan's average life expectancy was low compared with later decades. High infant mortality, infectious diseases, poor nutrition, and limited access to medical care all contributed to shortened lifespans. Tuberculosis, pneumonia, and diarrheal diseases were common causes of death, particularly among children and low-income populations. Rural areas had minimal access to trained physicians, and sanitation systems were often inadequate.
          </p>
          <p>
            World War II caused further challenges to public health. Bombing and destruction of cities disrupted housing, infrastructure, and food production. Malnutrition and overcrowded living conditions increased the spread of disease, and many citizens lacked access to consistent medical care. In the immediate postwar period, average life expectancy at birth was around 50 years, reflecting both longstanding public health issues and war-related hardships.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the 1950s onward, Japan experienced rapid improvements in life expectancy. Mortality from infectious diseases declined as vaccination campaigns, improved sanitation, and community-level disease control programs were implemented. Nutritional programs and better childhood healthcare contributed to higher survival rates. By the 1960s, average life expectancy had risen into the high 60s, showing a dramatic improvement from prewar levels.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the late twentieth century, Japan had become one of the countries with the highest life expectancy in the world. Life expectancy exceeded 80 years by the early 2000s due to decades of sustained public health efforts, preventative care, and improved access to medical services for all citizens. This historical transformation demonstrates how systematic interventions in healthcare, sanitation, nutrition, and disease prevention can lead to long-term gains in population health.

        <div class="thesis-content">
          <p>
            World War II had a profound and lasting impact on the health of Japan’s population. Extensive bombing destroyed housing, hospitals, sanitation systems, and transportation infrastructure in major cities, including Tokyo, Osaka, and Hiroshima. These disruptions severely limited access to clean water, adequate shelter, and medical services. As a result, mortality rates increased, particularly among children, the elderly, and those already suffering from chronic illness or malnutrition. The destruction of healthcare facilities also reduced the capacity to treat injuries and control disease during and immediately after the war.
          </p>
          <p>
            Food shortages during and after the war further worsened population health. Agricultural production declined due to labor shortages, damaged farmland, and disrupted supply chains. Many Japanese citizens experienced chronic undernutrition, which weakened immune systems and increased vulnerability to infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and pneumonia. Rationing systems were insufficient to meet nutritional needs, and black markets became common sources of food for those who could afford them. Malnutrition was especially severe among children, contributing to high infant and child mortality rates in the late 1940s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overcrowding and displacement intensified public health risks in the postwar period. Millions of people were left homeless and forced to live in temporary shelters or densely populated urban areas, creating conditions that facilitated the spread of communicable diseases. Poor sanitation and limited access to medical care allowed infections to spread rapidly. These combined factors meant that, in the years immediately following World War II, Japan faced a widespread public health crisis that kept life expectancy low and underscored the urgent need for large-scale public health intervention.
